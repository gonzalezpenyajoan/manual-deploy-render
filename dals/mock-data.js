It was great to have access to the two pools as well and towel service. We stayed here with two families with kids and the space worked well. The only thing that I would have added would have been the option for a daily cleaning service, but we also didn’t ask so perhaps it is available. Would definitely stay here again!"

The location is great, close to lots of bars and restaurants in the LES. Being on a smaller street the place is really quiet at night which was great. \r\n\r\nThe apartment is very spacious (unlike most NYC apartments) and the bed was very comfortable. A huge plus for sleepy travelers! Daniel has done a great job of styling the apartment and it is equipped with everything you would need. Shower pressure is good too!\r\n\r\nAs our host Daniel was very welcoming. He went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed an gave us some great tips about what to do during our stay in NYC. He was prompt with his communications with us and the whole process of picking up and leaving the keys was easy.\r\n\r\nWhen we come back to the city we will definitely stay at Daniel's place again. We would highly recommend it to everyone."

This unit has everything to make the stay great and comfortable . Having the washer and dryer is a big plus since we need to wash our wet clothes and towels from the beach every day. We were able to do some light cooking so we didn't have to eat out everyday. The best part of all is the hospitality shown by Mike and his lovely family. We walked into this cozy and beautiful unit feeling at home right away. There was a basket of fruit and goodies along with a bottle of wine on the table for us to enjoy.  Communication was always clear and Mike responded promptly whenever we contacted him. He went above and beyond to make sure our stay at his place is pleasant and comfortable while respecting our privacy. It felt like home while being away from home. Kudos to Mike and family. I highly recommend Mike's place for your stay here. You will love it! Thank you so much for being the best host, Mike. "

It was immaculate with upscale amenities like gorgeous bathroom with a washlet (now I want one in my house) and close to all major routs to take us anywhere on the island. Just perfect for a couple like us that wanted a little taste of life on Oahu. Mike made us feel very welcome and comfortable, made suggestions what to see and do and was very responsive to our inquires."

You want for nothing because everything is provided. The studio is fully stocked with amenities. A beautiful fruit and snack basket welcomes you when you arrive and a bottle of wine gives a romantic touch. The washlet toilet was amazing,and the washer dryer was a nice bonus! We felt like we were staying at a 5 star hotel.\nThe location is central to most places on Oahu, and Mike has a designated parking spot for his Airbnb guest. The neighborhood is quiet and we really enjoyed the comfort and relaxation at Mike's. We will definitely be back!"

There are a lot of artisan touches in the bedroom.  There is a koi pond and an day-time table area.  The  place is built as a studio so the bathroom is somewhat open - the walls don't reach the ceiling.  The bed is comfortable and there is a washer/dryer (brand new).  Mike the host and owner is very gracious and left us a bottle of wine and some island munchies and fruit upon arrival.  There is one parking spot next to the house on the sidewalk area - that is Alewa Heights for those who know the area - very tight.\n\nWe would definitely stay again.  Very good value for the price.  You do need a car unless you do ironman triathalons and want to like half way up Alewa Heights."

Locale is close to all major freeways, so we got to see all of the North, East, and Southeast sides of Honolulu in a week. I was sceptical of staying in the same property with the owner, but it turned out awesome. Privacy was there, while help was just a phone call away. Mike is truly a great host and new friend."

Air conditioning in the room does not really cool the room properly. It was more like a fan. \n\nThe building and location was pretty safe. There is a GoGet Pod right in front of the building which is very convenient if you use GoGet.

Definitely recommend and there is a host of amenities available if required. \n\nNot sure how well the air conditioner works, we used it for heating and it seemed to do the trick, even though we couldn't feel any air pressure. \n\nShower and bathroom are both clean and good. \n\nWe definitely recommend these hosts."

This included lots of information and personal suggestions for dining and sight seeing as well as an excellent customer service including his friend who welcomed us upon our arrival. \nThe appartement was very beautiful, comfortable and welcoming! We were on our business trip and this appartement, with a terrace and a charming small garden, made us feel like on holidays after long days of work. We would definitely recommend staying here!\n"

However, there was construction that started really early in the morning, around 7am in the morning! The construction noice woke us up and unfortunately was disruptive. Apart from the construction noise, the house was great and felt like home."
